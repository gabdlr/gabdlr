- 👋 Hi, I’m @gabdlr, I switched from pharmacy career to programming, but I know web programming since I was 14 at least, so, here I am.  
- 👀 I’m interested in making a career in programming I'm targeting at fintech not just because the money but because I also like investing money (and it's my plan to own life)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, well actually a lot, deeping on PHP, getting used to npm, packages, a lot of javascript, but i could point especifically React (at the moment).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever can help me improve and make an improvement.
- 📫 How to reach me I'm available on telegram as @gabdlr.
Final note: I'd like to finish pharmacy. I'm not a quitter, I just switched because I had this look at the greater picture. But hope I can at some point of life take it back.
