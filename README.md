- 👋 Hi, I’m @gabdlr, I've been programming for not so long, but I know web programming since I was 14 at least, so, here I am.  
- 👀 I'm very passionated about building things with programming, I like doing everything in the best possible way to achieve the best possible result, I find it really pleasant and enjoyable.
- 🌱 I'm a web developer and my main stack is the LAMP stack since I got involved early as a kid and there weren't many other options back then, anyway, I do like PHP but I've been exploring and learning the MERN stack, and in my personal programming time I'm pushing myself hard to improve my skills on it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with who ever thinks I could be helpful in a project that could be helpful to others.
- 📫 How to reach me I'm available on telegram as @gabdlr.

- 👣️ Before programming I did study pharmacy, I have sincere love for knowledge of any kind.
